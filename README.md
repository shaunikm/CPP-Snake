# CPP-Snake
### by Shaunik Musukula

A simple console-based snake game. The game is fit to compile in MacOS. As such, the only build I have created is for MacOS (located in the builds folder).

To compile the file yourself, run this command (assuming you start in the game's directory):
```
g++ ./src/main.cpp -lncurses -o ./build/main && ./build/main
```

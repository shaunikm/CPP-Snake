# CPP-Snake
### by Shaunik Musukula

A simple console-based snake game. The base `.cpp` files are fit to compile in Linux, MacOS, and similar operating systems. The only build I have created is for MacOS (located in the builds folder).
To run code on different operating systems, run this in the corresponding directory:
`g++ main.cpp -lncurses -o ../build/main`

It should build an executable for the game.

I have not created a version for Windows as some tools that I have used in the project cannot be compiled on Windows. To overcome this, I may rewrite some code to be able to be compiled on Windows.
